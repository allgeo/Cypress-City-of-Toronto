          <h1>Frequently Asked Questions </h1> <br>
          <h3> What is Cypress? </h3>
          The Cypress system is designed to allow citizens to report problems that concern them about their city that they notice on the streets. Along with that they will be able to follow up on the status of their problem
          from when it is first reported and until a solution is found <br> <br>

          <h3>How Does Cypress Work? </h3>
          A register user can report a problem to our website with the "Report a Problem" portal. This allows citizens to show the location of the problem followed with what the complaint is. After doing so our City Officials will be notified. They will try their best to resolve conflict then when it has been completed we notify the user that their problem has been resolved.  <br> <br>

          <h3> I forgot my password, how do I retrieve it? </h3>
          If you forgot your password, we will send a reset password link to your email address. <br><br>

  				<h3> How long will it take for a problem to be solved?</h3>
          The time it takes to solve a problem depends on many factors including the location, dispatching the proper authority, and<br> the priority of the problem.
